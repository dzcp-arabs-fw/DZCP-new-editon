   - Create classes that implement the necessary interfaces provided by the framework.

3. **Handle Events**:

   - Utilize the event system to respond to in-game events.

4. **Build and Deploy**:

   - Compile your plugin and place the resulting DLL into the server's plugin directory.

5. **Test and Iterate**:

   - Test your plugin in a controlled environment before deploying to a live server.
